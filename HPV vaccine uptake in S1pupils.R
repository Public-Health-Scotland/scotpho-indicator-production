# This script updates the following 2 indicators:
# 99145 - HPV vaccine uptake in S1 females
# 99146 - HPV vaccine uptake in S1 pupils (males and females)


# As of Aug 2025, these replace the 'HPV vaccine uptake in S3 girls' indicator (see R script in Archived Indicators folder)
# In early days of HPV vaccine program, it was 3 doses for females only starting in S2
# Currently, it's administered as a single dose to both males and females in S1
# Therefore old indicator was archived and new indicators created to better
# reflect current JCVI guidance and vaccination schedule in schools 

# Trend for females starts from 2014/15 as this was the first year offer shifted to S1 females. 
# The universal offer (both males and females in S1) wasn't introduced until 2019/20 so 
# trend for all pupils indicator starts later.


# files produced:
# main: Y (2 files)

# deprivation: Y (2 files)
