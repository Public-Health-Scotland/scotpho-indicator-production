# data requested from PHS child health team each year following the release of P1 BMI publication (typically published Dec):
# https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/primary-1-body-mass-index-bmi-statistics-scotland/

# The team provide 2 extracts:
# data based on 2011 datazones - for main and deprivation analysis (to match post 2013 data to later versions of SIMD that are DZ01 based)
# data based on 2001 datazones - for deprivation analysis only (to match pre-2013 data to early versions of SIMD that are DZ11 based)

# Data is provided at DZ level but need to cross-reference with published data and remove some larger geographies. 
# Coverage is very low/non existent in some areas meaning the published data has some boards/councils suppressed. 
# but we have been provided data for datazones that fall within these suppressed areas.


# files produced:
# main_dataset: Y
# deprivation_dataset: Y
# popgroups_dataset: Y (sex splits)


# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 1 - load packages / source functions  ----
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

source("functions/main_analysis.R") # for main analysis
source("functions/deprivation_analysis.R") # for deprivation analysis 
library(phsopendata) # for extracting published opendata to identify areas to suppress


# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 2 - read raw data ----
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# path to folder where raw data saved once team send over
folder <- file.path(profiles_data_folder, "Received Data", "Child Healthy Weight")

# read in data files (update each year to reflect new IR number)
dz_01 <- readRDS(file.path(folder, "IR2024-00930_DZ2001.rds")) # 2001 datazones 
dz_11 <- readRDS(file.path(folder, "IR2024-00930_DZ2011.rds")) # 2011 datazones


# create numeric year cols using starting year of school year
dz_01$year <- as.numeric(paste0("20", substr(dz_01$schlyr_exam, 1, 2)))
dz_11$year <- as.numeric(paste0("20", substr(dz_11$schlyr_exam, 1, 2)))

# rename dz code columns

colnames(dz_11)[1] <- "datazone" 



# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 3 - prepare main dataset file  ----
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# create temp data
# calculating the numerator (total with healthy BMI)
# and denominator (total reviewed) for each datazone and year
main_temp <- dz_11 |>
  group_by(datazone, year) |>

# save temp file to pass to analysis function
saveRDS(main_temp, file.path(profiles_data_folder, "Prepared Data", "child_healthyweight_raw.rds"))

# run function to prepare final file

# note this will produce the following warning:
#   There was 1 warning in `mutate()`.
# â„¹ In argument: `pcf = case_when(...)`.
# Caused by warning in `sqrt()`:
#   ! NaNs produced 

# this occurs when calculating the population correction factor (PCF) when the estimated population is 
# larger than the denominator e.g more P1 children reviewed in an area than 
# the estimated no. of 5 year olds in that area resulting in a PCF of less than 0
# Warning can be ignored. When this happens the confidence intervals
# will be made the same as the rate on assumption that the whole population has been reviewed
