## This script prepares SG recorded crime profile indicators:
##      Breach of the Peace
##      Common assault
##      Drug crimes recorded
##      Vandalism
##      Violent crime
##      Attempted murder & serious assault 

## Data are bulk downloaded from statistics.scot.gov.uk:
# https://statistics.gov.scot/resource?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fstatistics.gov.scot%2Fdata%2Frecorded-crime

## D/l entire dataset as a CSV file and save as:
#     .\Data\Received Data\rec_crime_received

## Function arguments:
#   id = indicator ID 
#   topic = ""
