# To do:

# Get HBSC to provide more guidance on WHO5 mental wellbeing score, 2018 and 2022:
# score given in 2022, but only positive/low/depression risk in 2018 (and who_3cat and who_low in 2018 seem counter-intuitively coded: pos mood =risk or dep and vice versa...) How to use these comparably?

# Look into the Family Affluence Scale as possible split: not easily comparable across years as yet.

# Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey data import
######################################################################

# Originally, 6 of the CYP MHIs were intended to be sourced from the HBSC, and 29 from the new HWB Census.
# In 2025 we decided that the HWB Census data would not be presented as there is only one data point, it is not complete for Scotland, and we don't know when it will be repeated, if it is.
# A further 18 of the 29 HWB Census indicators can be obtained from the HBSC. 
# This gives a time series, although data collection is only every 4 years, and is Scotland wide (no sub-national breakdowns).
# The survey is asked of pupils in P7, S2 and S4. 
# Scottish P7 pupils are approx. age 11 and in the final year of primary school. 
# S2 are approx. 13 years old and S4 approx. 15 years old.

# Data source:
# Requested from Joanna.Inchley@glasgow.ac.uk.
# Latest data (to 2022) transferred in Feb 2025.
# Next survey = 2026

# HBSC team advise:
# start at 1998 as prior to that were not full national samples
# no suppression needed
# weights started to be used from 2010 (or 2014 for weights that equated the contribution of the 3 grades, so that the CIs for whole sample estimates could reflect this)
# HBSC still present weighted and unweighted estimates together. I will check to see if this looks OK. Preliminary checks suggest it is OK. 
# adjust for clustered survey design: pupils within schools within strata. The team advised which variables to use in each year. 


### CYP mental health indicators: 

# 30100	Children's mental wellbeing =	Mean mental wellbeing score (WHO-5 wellbeing index). Derived from responses to five statements about how the respondent has been feeling during the past two weeks. Items = have felt cheerful and in good spirits / I have felt calm and relaxed / I have felt active and vigorous / I woke up feeling fresh and rested / My daily life has been filled with things that interest me. A score of 50 or less is classified as low mood.  (2018 and 2022 only)
# 30104	Children reporting high life satisfaction =	% of pupils reporting high life satisfaction (a score of 6 or more from 0 (worst possible life) to 10 (best possible life))
# 30111	Children meeting physical activity guidelines =	% of pupils reporting doing 1 hour or more of physical activity every day
# 30112	Children getting sufficient sleep =	% of pupils getting at least 8 hours sleep on a school night, on average. Calculated from their reported usual bedtime and waking time on a schoolday.
# 30113	Children's sleep quality score =	Adolescent Sleep Wake Scale (ASWS) mean score. Derived from responses to 10 items covering bedtime behaviours, sleep efficiency, and morning wakefulness. 
# 30114	Children assessing their general health as good or excellent =	% of pupils who perceive their health in general to be good or excellent (as opposed to fair or poor).
# 30115	Children with limiting long-term conditions =	% of pupils reporting an illness, disability or medical condition that affects their attendance or participation in school.
# 30116	Children with problematic social media usage = % of pupils with problematic social media use, based on responses to 9 items. Problematic usage defined as scoring 6+ out of 9.
# During the past year, have you… regularly found that you can’t think
# of anything else but the moment that you will be able to use social media again? / ...regularly felt dissatisfied because you wanted to
# spend more time on social media? / ..often felt bad when you could not use social media? / ..tried to spend less time on social media
# but failed?/..regularly neglected other activities (e.g hobbies, sport) because you wanted to use social media? / ..regularly had arguments
# with others because of your social media use? / ..regularly lied to your parents or friends about the amount of time you spend on social
# media?/..often used social media to escape from negative feelings? /  ...had serious conflict with your parents, brother(s) or sister (s)
# because of your social media use?
# 30117	Children thinking they are overweight =	% of pupils that think their body is a bit overweight or very overweight. (NB. Pre-2022 the wording included 'fat' rather than 'overweight' so is not comparable.)
# 30124	Children finding it easy to talk to parents =	% of pupils reporting it is easy/very easy to at least one of their parents about things that really bother them. (combination of variables including step parents)
# 30126	Children reporting high level of family support =	% of pupils reporting having high level of family support. Based on the family subscale of the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), and derived from 4 items (My family really tries to help me / I get the emotional help and support I need from my family / I can talk about my problems with my family / My family is willing to help me make decisions). A score of 5.5+ classified as high family support. (original MHI was 'enjoy living with family')
# 30133	Children reporting high level of peer support =	% of pupils reporting having high level of peer support. Based on the peer subscale of the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), and derived from 4 items (My friends really try to help me / I can count on my friends when things go wrong / I have friends with whom I can share my joys and sorrows / I can talk about my problems with my friends.). A score of 5.5+ classified as high peer support.
# 30134	Children rarely feeling lonely =	% of pupils reporting never or rarely feeling lonely in past year.
# 30137	Children feeling accepted by classmates =	% of pupils who strongly agree or agree that other pupils accept them as they are.
# 30138	Children being bullied at school =	% of pupils reporting having been bullied at school at least 2-3 times a month in the past couple of months.
# 30139	Children being cyberbullied =	% of pupils reporting having been cyberbullied at least 2-3 times a month in the past couple of months. Examples given: someone sent mean instant messages, email or text messages
# about you; wall postings; created a website making fun of you; posted unflattering or inappropriate pictures of you online without permission or shared them with others)
# 30141	Children liking school =	% of pupils who like school a lot or a bit at present 
# 30142	Children reporting high level of teacher support =	% of pupils reporting they receive a high level of teacher support. Based on 3 items (I feel that my teachers accept me as I am / I feel that my teachers care about me as a person / I feel a lot of trust in my teachers.). Score of 10+ out of 12 classified as high teacher support. 
# 30144	Children feeling pressure of school work =	% of pupils reporting feeling a lot of schoolwork pressure.
# 30148	Children participating in clubs, groups or organisations each week =	% of pupils participating in organised leisure activities each week (i.e., activities carried out under the leadership of a coach, teacher, instructor or leader). 
# 30149	Children having a trusted adult =	% of pupils who have an adult they can trust and talk to about any personal problems (sometimes or always)
# 30150	Children feeling safe in their neighbourhood =	% of pupils who report always feeling safe in the area they live in. 
# 30163	Children experiencing discrimination from adults =	% of pupils who report often or very often being treated unfairly by adults because of their sex, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. 
# 30164	Children thinking their neighbourhood is a good place to live =	% of pupils who think that the area in which they live is a good place to live
